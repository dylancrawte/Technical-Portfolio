      <h1>Hi There!</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Dylan Crawte, a full stack developer currently working for International Airlines Group.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am driven by creativity and curiosity, and aim to develop interesting,
        engaging applications that push the boundaries of innovation. I have a
        passion for all things technology and design; from software engineering
        & UX design, to music production and computational
        neuroscience!
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work I am passionate about music, both playing live and
        producing. I also am a University of Bristol graduate,
        where in my master's year had the opportunity to delve into the world of
        computational neuroscience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please enjoy some of my projects below and feel free to get in touch!

            Meet Go43 - the platform which connects music labels with TikTok influencers for their marketing campaigns.
          <p>
            The app was built using React Expo, MongoDB backend with an Express API layer (MERN). 
            It is live on the iOS app store and features public TikTok API integration, for both user sign in and campaign analytic reporting.
          <p>  
            I built the app's MVP independently, and recruited and managed a small team of engineers for later version releases.

           Both inside and outside of work, custom AI Agents are pivotal to my workflow. 
          <p>
            In my start up - an R&D RAG Agent proved essential to understand the current market and gaps we could fill. 
            During my day job, a useful tool I have built is the Tech Compass agent, which uses a specific knowledge base of company documents to answer 
            questions employees may have about approved technologies.
          <p>
            AWS Bedrock is a powerful framework for building more complex agents, whilst copilot studio helps me rapidly develop an idea into a useable tool, 
            such as my React Expo Helper - an agent hooked up to the Expo documentation to assist with daily development tasks and problems!

            When i first joined IAG, they had me manually filling out the monthly
            newsletter. So, I designed a system that automatically retrieves news articles and
            generates a report of summaries. It features weekly, automated
            emailing, a dynamic date filter for the content, and embedded
            hyperlinks to the articles in the titles.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project is designed and maintained by myself. It began as a python script that utilised a news API, 
            but has since been changed to a more effective power automate solution.

            This project is a fun and simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe on the front
            end, but the magic lies underneath the hood, in the form of a
            mini-max algorithm that creates an AI bot to play against. It also includes an interactive background, and displayed persistent data of the win records. Good
            luck!

            As mentioned, I have a passion for music, and it only felt right to
            include some of that in this portfolio. I use Ableton Live
            for production, with a range of plug ins and live
            instrumentation to achieve what I consider to be a pretty unique
            sound. I've had tracks featured in Spotify's editorial playlists, as
            well as support from artists such as My Nu Leng and Dr Dubplate.

         At University, I studied Neuroscience, and in my master's year, my dissertation focused around EEG and computational neuroscience. 
         The successful project involved working with a stimulation pattern that aligned with the peaks and troughs of a participants 
         EEG signal (closed-loop stimulation), as a treatment for neuro-muscular conditions. 
         The project involved work using Python to design and edit the stimulation pattern, as well as analysing the data collected from the participant.
